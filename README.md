# Unit-Converter-With-Java
A simple and useful Java program that allows you to calculate and convert between different units of measurement, such as length, area, and volume. 
This program provides a command-line interface for performing unit conversions.

This program provides a menu where you can select the category (Length, Area, or Volume) you want to convert. 
After selecting a category, it prompts you to enter a value in the base unit (e.g., meters for length) 
and then displays the equivalent values in other units. This simple utility program can be very useful for quick unit conversions.
